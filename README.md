# About this

This is a Django framework based application. However this uses the elements of Django and provides a fast way to build applications. 

This is a quick and dirty way to standup applications to show the prof of concept. 
I created this to teach the web UI part for data scientists. 

It can be started up and running in few minutes if you have python experience.
This is to be used only for educational purpose and not suited for commercial application.
It has many security holes.



## Intallation
