                Our mission is to organize the world’s information and make it accessible and useful. AI is helping us do that in exciting new ways, solving problems for our users, our customers, and the world.
AI is making it easier for people to do things every day, whether it’s searching for photos of loved ones, breaking down language barriers in Google Translate, typing emails on the go, or getting things done with the AI Assistant. AI also provides new ways of looking at existing problems, from rethinking healthcare to advancing scientific discovery.
                
                <br>
                
            <p>        
            We want to use AI to augment the abilities of people, to enable us to accomplish more and to allow us to spend more time on our creative endeavors.

<h3>    Working together to apply AI for social good </h3>
an open call to organizations around the world to submit their ideas for how they could use AI to help address societal challenges. We received applications from 3 countries, spanning 6 continents with projects ranging from environmental to humanitarian. We work with 20 organizations to support. These  organizations are receiving customized support to help bring their ideas to life: coaching from our AI experts, we offer and invest from a funding pool, credit and consulting, and more.

                                <p>we will foster a "can do" entrepreneurial spirit with speed and flexibility in all that we do, including the fastest "from concept to Customer" time and a rapid "from creation to market" time. As we grow larger, it is important to keep the excitement and competitive differentiation of a small company. That spirit also includes embracing change as an opportunity for growth - we will not be successful by doing the same things that we've done well historically again and again. Our world, our markets, our Customers, will always be changing and we must evolve to compete.

    AI can help, but it’s not a silver bullet: tackling these questions requires a concerted, collaborative effort across all sectors of society. We believe that we can meaningfully contribute, drawing on the scale of our products and services, investment in AI research, and our commitment to using and developing AI responsibly. We’re doing that through AI for Social Good, a program that focuses our AI expertise on solving humanitarian and environmental challenges.

Our work is centered on two pillars: applying core  research and engineering efforts to projects with positive societal impact, including partnering with experts, and empowering the ecosystem with tools and resources through initiatives like the  AI Impact Challenge.
